All NNLO C-factors calculated with NNPDF3.0 benchmark settings
(TheoryID 3) should be stored here in the format specified in the
document "data_layout.pdf" which can be found at /data/docs/.

When adding a new QCD C-factor, you must add the name of the multiplying
grid, along with the setname, to the file
	registeredCFactors.dat

This file lists the C-factors to be converted when moving to a theory
with a different alpha_S value.

==============================================

Package structure:
	doc/ -> documentation physics + code
	testevolqed/ -> C++ example
	testfortran/ -> Fortran example

1. Introduction

This is a C++ library composed by a single class
which computes the QED evolution factors in the
Mellin space N. For the physics documentation
see the folder doc/. For the doxygen documentation
take a look in doc/doxygen

2. How it works

The idea is very simple you initialize the class
    EvolQED *evol = new EvolQED(nf, run);

Then you get the solution by calling the method:
    evol->EvolFactNQED(N, Q2I, Q2F, EGNNS, EGNSG);

3. Installation

Just type:
     make -j2
EvolQED depends on the following external libs:
     gsl -> for special functions like digamma
     lapack -> for zgeev diagonalization algorithm 

4. Testing

Just do:
     cd testevolqed
     make
     ./testevolqed

5. Using with fortran code

There is a fortran module available which is
compiled inside the libevolqed.a
For an example take a look on testfortran folder

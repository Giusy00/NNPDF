\section{PlotPdf}

The plotpdf project is the plotting engine which is attached to the validphys report. With this program you can generate reports with only pdf plots, such as pdf comparisons, ratios, replicas both in the evolution and flavor basis, and if the par files are available you can generate the preprocessing plots automatically.

\subsection{Running plotpdf}

For example you can run plotpdf by doing:

\begin{lstlisting}
./plotpdf example.ini plotting.ini (or simply ./plotpdf example.ini)
\end{lstlisting}

You can set custom option by editting the plotting.ini file and modifying the keys at [report], [validphys] and [PDFs] sections.

\subsection{Interpreting results}

After running plotpdf, you will find a:
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{\textbf{plotpdf.log}} file in \texttt{RESULTSDIR}, which contains
the configuration used to generated plotpdf. 
\item \texttt{\textbf{RESULTSDIR/plotpdf}} folder containing all the generated plots together with a makefile and report.tex, which allow you to generate a single document with all plots inside. 
\end{itemize}

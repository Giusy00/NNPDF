SWIG wrappers
=============

The wrappers here generate the `NNPDF` Python package, which is used within
validphys. They are normally compiled and installed as a part of the NNPDF
setup.

See

https://docs.nnpdf.science/get-started/installation.html

For more details on the setup see `CMakeLists.txt`.

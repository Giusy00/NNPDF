Using conda

Download the appropriate version for your OS from:

http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html


Either download a python 3 version of conda, or else if you have
a python 2 one, create a python 3 installation ("environment") doing:

conda create -name py3 python=3

and then every time you want to use (or install something in that) do:

source activate py3

and then install swig with:

conda install swig


= INSTALL

first compile and install libnnpdf then type make from this folder or make wrapper from the libnnpdf/ root folder.

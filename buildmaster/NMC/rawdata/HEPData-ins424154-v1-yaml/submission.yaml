  CERN-SPS. Measurement of the proton and deuteron structure functions F2 and of the ratio R = SIG(L)/SIG(T) in muon proton and muon deuteron deep inelastic scattering at incident muon energies of 90, 120, 200 and 280 GeV. Data covers the kinematic range of x from 0.002 to 0.60 and Q**2 from 0.5 to 75 GeV**2. This is an analysis of the full data set collected by the NMC including the small angle trigger.

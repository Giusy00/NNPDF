#: name: Figure 19a - Diff. Fid. XS for $p_{T}^{4l}$
#: description: Differential fiducial cross section for the transverse momentum $p_{T}^{4l}$ of the Higgs boson. The measured cross sections are compared to predictions provided by NNLOPS + XH. NNLOPS is normalised to the N3LO total cross section with a K-factor = 1.1 . Measured value in the last bin is un upper limit at 95% CL.

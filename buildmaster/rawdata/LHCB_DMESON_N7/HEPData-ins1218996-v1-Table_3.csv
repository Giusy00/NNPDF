#: name: Table 3
#: description: Differential production cross-sections with respect to transverse momentum, dsigma / dp_T, of D+ mesons or their charge conjugates in  proton-proton collisions at center-of-mass (CM) energy sqrt(s) = 7 TeV. Measured in bins of hadron transverse momentum (p_T) and rapidity (y) with respect to the beam axis, where p_T and y are measured in the CM frame. Contributions of charm hadrons from the decays of b-hadrons have been removed.

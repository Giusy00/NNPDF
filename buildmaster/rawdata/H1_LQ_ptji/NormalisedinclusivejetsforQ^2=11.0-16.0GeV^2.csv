#: name: Normalised inclusive jets for $Q^2$ = 11.0-16.0 GeV$^2$
#: description: Normalised inclusive jet cross sections measured as a function of $P_T^{\rm jet}$ for $Q^2$ = 11.0-16.0 GeV$^2$.  The correction factors on the theoretical cross sections $c^{\rm had}$ are listed together with their uncertainties.  The radiative correction factors $c^{\rm rad}$ are already included in the quoted cross sections.  Note that the uncertainties labelled $\delta^{E_{e^\prime}}$ and $\delta^{\theta_{e^\prime}}$ in Table 9 of the paper (arXiv:1611.03421v3) should be swapped.  See Table 5 of arXiv:1406.4709v2 for details of the correlation model.

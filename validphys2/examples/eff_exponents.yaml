# This RunCard is used to generate the effective exponents plots implemented
# in eff_exponents.py. The effective exponents are the optimal a (alpha) and
# b (beta) exponents such as pdf = x^a (1-x)^b NN(x) fit has the minimal error
# function.

Q: 1.65 #Q is the PDF scale in GeV.
basis: 'evolution' #The evolution basis of the DGLAP equations

pdfs:

Here we compare the variations of the main NNPDF 3.1 sets at the level
of PDFs and luminosity. Each section contains:

 - PDF comparison plots, at a low and a high energy scale, in the
   flavour and the evolution basis.

 - PDF *distances* computed for each point in $x$.

 - PDF luminosities at {@sqrts@} GeV.

 - Differential PDF luminosity uncertainties at {@sqrts@} GeV.

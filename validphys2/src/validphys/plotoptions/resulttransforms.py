Transform the result (central value and error) for plotting.

The functions here receive as arguments the original cental value and
error (from e.g. the convolution or commondata) as well as all the labels
defined in the plotting file, as keyword arguments.
They are expected to return a new central value and a new error. Therefore
the signature is:


.. code-block:: python

    def xbinexp(cv, error, **labels):
        ...
        return newcv, newerror

Note that these functions will be called point by point
(rather than on lists of values).

        qbin = labels['qbin']
    except KeyError:
        raise KeyError()
    return 10**qbin*cv, 10**qbin*error


def qbinjets(cv, error, **labels):
    try:
        qbin = labels['k1']
    except KeyError:
        raise KeyError()
    return 10**qbin*cv, 10**qbin*error

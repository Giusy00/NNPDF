# NNPDF: An open-source machine learning framework for global analyses of parton distributions

[The NNPDF collaboration](http://nnpdf.science) determines the structure of the
proton using Machine Learning methods. This is the main repository of the
fitting and analysis frameworks. In particular it contains all the necessary
tools to [reproduce](https://docs.nnpdf.science/tutorials/reproduce.html) the
NNPDF4.0 PDF determinations.

## Documentation

The documentation is available at <https://docs.nnpdf.science/>

## Install

See the [Installation
Guide](https://docs.nnpdf.science/get-started/installation.html). Please note
that the [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) based workflow described in
the documentation is the only supported one. While it may be possible to set up
the code in different ways, we won't be able to provide any assistance.

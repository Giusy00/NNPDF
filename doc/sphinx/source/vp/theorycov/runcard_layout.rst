Important information about runcard layout
==========================================

-  The default behaviour for the 7-point prescription is to use Gavin
   Salam's modification to it. To use the original 7-point prescription
   instead, the ``seventheories`` flag must be set to ``original``.

-  As a fit you must provide the fit for central scales at the relevant
   order.

-  You must also provide the relevant c-factors (EWK, QCD ...).

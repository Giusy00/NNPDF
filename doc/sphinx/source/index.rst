The NNPDF collaboration
=================
The `NNPDF collaboration <https://nnpdf.mi.infn.it/>`_ performs research in the field of  high-energy physics. The NNPDF
collaboration determines the structure of the proton using
contemporary methods of artificial intelligence. A precise knowledge
of the so-called **Parton Distribution Functions (PDFs)** of the
proton, which describe their structure in terms of their quark and
gluon constituents, is a crucial ingredient of the physics program of
the Large Hadron Collider of CERN.


The NNPDF code
=============
The scientific output of the collaboration is freely available to the
publi through the arXiv, journal repositories, and software
repositories. Along with this online documentation, we release the
`NNPDF code <https://github.com/NNPDF/nnpdf>`_ used to produce the latest family of PDFs from NNPDF, NNPDF4.0. The code is made available as an open-source package together with the user-friendly examples and an extensive documentation presented here.

The code can be used to produce the ingredients needed for PDF fits, to run the fits themselves, and to analyse the results. This is the first framework used to produce a global PDF fit made publicly  available, enabling for a detailed external validation and reproducibility of the NNPDF4.0 analysis. Moreover, the code enables the user to explore a number of phenomenological applications, such as the assessment of the impact of new experimental data on PDFs, the effect of changes in theory settings on the resulting PDFs and a fast quantitative comparison between theoretical predictions and experimental data over a broad range of observables.

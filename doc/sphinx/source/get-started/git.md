## Git and GitHub

*Author: Cameron Voisey, 10/10/2019*

### Git

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is the version control system adopted within the NNPDF Collaboration. Among other things, Git allows multiple people to edit code simultaneously; it allows users to track changes to the code, i.e. a user can see who edited what and when; and, it allows a user to transport to any past version of the code. The latter is particularly useful for running tests should a bug be introduced to the code.

#### Learning Git

Learning to use Git can be slightly painful and confusing at first, but once you have mastered the basics you will wonder how you ever lived without it. However, Git is probably the most popular version control system out there at the moment, so investing the time to learn it is not just useful for NNPDF-related work. I would therefore recommend setting aside some time to learn Git. Myriads of online tutorials exist, but the one that I have used is in the past is available for free on [codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-git). A quicker tutorial can also be found [here](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/).

### GitHub

[GitHub](https://github.com/) is a code development platform that uses Git as its means of version control. Other such platforms are available, e.g. [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/), but GitHub is the most popular platform and it is the one used within the NNPDF Collaboration. GitHub allows its users to view code on the web, propose changes to the code, discuss code, and review code.

Several guides to using GitHub can be found on their [website](https://guides.github.com/).

#### Setting up GitHub

You can get an account for free by going [here](https://github.com/join). To join the NNPDF organisation please ask Stefano Carrazza or Zahari Kassabov and they can send you an invitation.

In order to push code to the NNPDF repositories, your ssh keys should be installed in one of GitHub or GitLab. In particular:

* You should add a valid ssh key to GitHub. You can do this by following the instructions [here](https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account)

* If you have a valid CERN account, you should [login]() and add the public ssh key(s) from your computer

* If you do not have a valid CERN account, you should send your public ssh key(s) to Stefano Carrazza and he will add them for you

### Development workflow

You can find the NNPDF organisation [here](https://github.com/NNPDF). Within the [nnpdf](https://github.com/NNPDF/nnpdf) repository, example [issues](https://github.com/NNPDF/nnpdf/issues) and [pull requests](https://github.com/NNPDF/nnpdf/pulls) can be found by viewing those that are currently open.

There are many ingredients that go into a PDF fit. For example, one must generate the partonic cross sections for use in the fit, convert these predictions into a format that is suitable for PDF fits, i.e. the format must be suitable for on-the-fly convolutions, and evolve the PDFs according to the DGLAP equations. To perform each of these steps, different codes are used. In this subsection various codes that you will frequently encounter are described.

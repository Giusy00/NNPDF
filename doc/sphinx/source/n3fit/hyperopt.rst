================================ 
Hyperoptimization algorithm
================================

Motivation
----------
While the methodology used up to the 3.1 release of NNPDF considerably reduced the dependency on the
functional form of the PDFs, there existed a bias regarding the choice of hyperparameters that define
the NNPDF neural network and optimization strategy.

Of the main advantages introduced by the ``n3fit`` framework with respect to ``nnfit`` is the
possibility of running fits in a fraction of the time. This allow us to reduce the dependence of the
hyperparameters by running a grid scan on the relevant parameters. Together with an appropriate
figure of merit this grid search or *hyperparameter scan* will minimize the bias of the network
finding the best one for each possible situation.

The final goal is for the methodology to be robust enough that a change in the physics
(fitted experiments, choice of basis, choice of constraints, ...) depends only on a new run of the
hyperparameter scan to be functional.


Figure of merit
---------------
Our goal when running a hyperparameter scan is not just to find the hyperparameter combination that
produces the minimal :math:`\chi^2`. In fact, looking for the minimal :math:`\chi^2` is known to
produce overlearning even when optimizing on the validation loss, as can be seen
`here <https://vp.nnpdf.science/yG3XvinBQriLdqqTAHg3Sw==/>`_.

Despite producing a very good :math:`\chi^2`, the previous fit will fail when challenged with new
non-seen data. This needs to be accounted for by the figure of merit.

The desired features of this figure of merit can be summarized as:

1. Produce a low :math:`\chi^2` for both fitted experiments and non-fitted experiments.
2. Be stable upon random fluctuations.
3. Be reliable even when the number of points is not extremely large.



K-folding cross-validation
--------------------------
A good compromise between all previous points is the usage of the cross validation technique
usually known as `k-folds <https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/Papers/ESLII.pdf#page=260>`_.

When k-folding  we take all datapoints in our fit (in this case one datapoint refers to one dataset)
and break it down into *k* partitions. Now, for every combination of hyperparameter we do *k* fits,
leaving out a different partition each time.
At the end of the fit we test the goodness of the fit with the data that was left out.
In this way all datasets are used exactly once for testing of the hyperparameters
(and *k-1* times for fitting).

For the fit we perform the usual training validation split within each dataset and use it for
stopping.

The choice of this method for selecting the hyperparameter of the NNPDF fitting methodology
are discussed `in the mailing list <https://lists.cam.ac.uk/mailman/private/ucam-nnpdf/2020-March/msg00066.html>`_.
Some public discussion about the different hyperoptimization techniques that has been used and
tested during the development of ``n3fit`` can be found in `public slides <http://n3pdf.mi.infn.it/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/JCruz-Martinez_Mexico_102019.pdf>`_
as well as in `internal presentations <https://www.wiki.ed.ac.uk/display/nnpdfwiki/Amsterdam+Feb+2020+NNPDF+Collaboration+Meeting+agenda?preview=/432523942/436448892/juanCM.pdf>`_.



**Under construction:**
the choice of figure of merit is still under development, but we have several possibilities

1. We can take the combination that produces the best average for the partitions' :math:`\chi^2`

.. math::
    L_{hyperopt} = \frac{1}{N_{k}} \sum \chi^2

2. We can take the combination that produces the *best* *worst* loss

.. math::
    L_{hyperopt} = max(\chi^2)


Implementation
--------------

The hyperparameter scan capabilities are implemented using the `hyperopt <https://github.com/hyperopt/hyperopt>`_ framework which
systematically scans over a selection of parameter using Bayesian optimization and measures model
performance to select the best architecture.
A `Jupyter Notebook is provided <https://github.com/NNPDF/tutorials/blob/master/hyperparameter%20scan/Hyperparameter%20scan.ipynb>`_
with a practical example of usage of the hyperopt framework. This example is a simplified version
of the hyperparameter scan used in ``n3fit``.
The hyperopt library implements the tree-structured of
Parzen estimator which is a robust sequential model based optimization approach `[SMBO] <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperparameter_optimization>`_.

We optimize on a combination of the best validation loss and stability of the fits. In other words,
we select the architecture which produces the lowest validation loss after we trim those
combinations which are deemed to be unstable.

.. note::
    The fits done for hyperoptimization are one-replica fits. We take advantage of the
    stability of the Gradient Descent and of the fact that the difference between set of hyperparameters
    is small. This is a trade-off as we sustain a loss of "accuracy" (as some very ill-behave replicas
    might destroy good sets of parameters) in exchange for being able to test many more parameters in
    the same time. Once a multireplica ``n3fit`` is implemented we can hyperoptimize without having to
    rely in the one-replica proxy without a loss of performance.

From the fitting point of view, the implementation of the `k-folding` is done by setting to 0 all
experimental data points and masking to 0 the respective predictions from the Neural Network.
In the code this means that during the data reading phase ``n3fit`` also creates one mask per kfold
per experiment to apply to the experimental data before compiling the Neural Network.
Note that this is not a boolean mask dropping the points but rather just sets the data to 0.
The reason for doing it in this way is to minimize the number of things that change when doing a
hyperparameter scan with respect to a scan.


Interpretation
--------------

While performing the hyperparameter scan we found that optimizing only looking at the validation
loss produced results which would usually be considered overfitted: very low training and validation
:math:`\chi^2` and complex replica patterns. Thanks to the high performance of the ``n3fit`` procedure the
usual cross-validation algorithm used in the NNPDF framework was not enough to prevent overlearning
for all architectures.

The cross-validation implemented in NNPDF is successful on avoiding the learning of the noise within
a dataset. However, we observe that this choice is not enough to prevent overfitting due to
correlations within points in a same dataset when using hyperopt with ``n3fit``.

For hyperopt we have implemented k-folding cross-validation.
This method works by refitting with the same set of parameters several times (k times) each time leaving out
a partition of the datasets.
By using this method we reduce the bias associated with a particular choice of the datasets to leave out
while at the same time, refitting with the same set of parameters, allow us to assess the stability of the
particular combination of hyperparameters.

Practical Usage
---------------

The partitions can be chosen by adding a ``kfold::partitions`` key to the ``hyperscan`` dictionary.

.. code-block:: yaml

    kfold:
        verbosity:
            training: True
            kfold: True
        threshold: 5.0
        penalties:
            saturation: True
        partitions:
            - overfit: True
              datasets:
                - data_1
                - data_2
            - datasets:
                - data_3
            - datasets:
                - data_4
                - data_5

The ``overfit`` flag, when applied to one of the partitions, introduces this partition in the
training data. This is useful for very broad scans where we to find an architecture which is able to
fit, without worrying about things like overlearning which might be a second order problem.

The ``threshold_loss`` flag will make the fit stop if any of the partitions produces a loss greater
than the given threshold. This is useful for quickly discarding hyperparameter subspaces without
needing to do all ``k`` fits.

The ``verbosity`` dictionary allows fine control on what to report each 100 epochs. When both ``training``
and ``kfold`` are set to ``False``, nothing is printed until the end of the fit of the fold.
When set to ``True``, the losses for the training (training and validation) and for the partition are printed.

During hyperoptimization we might want to search for specific features, such as quickly fitting
(giving an incentive to quicker runs) or avoiding saturation (increasing the loss for models that
have produce saturation after a fit). New penalties can easily be added in the ``src/n3fit/hyper_optimization/penalties.py`` file.

An example runcard can be found at ``n3fit/runcards/Basic_hyperopt.yml``.

The loss function is currently computed as the average of the loss function over the partition sets.

.. math::
    L_{hyperopt} = \frac{1}{N_{k}} \sum (L_{k})



The hyperoptimization procedure performed in `hep-ph/1907.05075 <https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.05075>`_
used a slightly different approach in order to avoid overfitting,
by leaving out a number of datasets to compute a "testing set".
The loss function was then computed as

.. math::
    L_{hyperopt} = \frac{1}{2} (L_{validation} + L_{testing})

The group of datasets that were left out were:


* NMC
* BCDMSP
* BCDMSD
* HERACOMBNCEP460
* H1HERAF2B
* D0ZRap
* CDFR2KT
* D0WMASY
* ATLASZHIGHMASS49FB
* CMSZDIFF12

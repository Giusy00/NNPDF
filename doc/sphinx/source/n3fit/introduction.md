Introduction to `n3fit`
=============================

`n3fit` is the next generation fitting code for NNPDF developed by the N3PDF team.

We present a new regression model for the determination of parton distribution functions (PDF) using techniques inspired from deep learning projects. In the context of the NNPDF methodology, we implement a new efficient computing framework based on graph generated models for PDF parametrization and gradient descent optimization. The best model configuration is derived from a robust cross-validation mechanism through a hyperparametrization tune procedure. We show that results provided by this new framework outperforms the current state-of-the-art PDF fitting methodology in terms of best model selection and computational resources usage.

The documentation for the code has been autogenerated using sphinx and can be found [here](../modules/n3fit-code/n3fit).

In the next sections we provide a methodological overview about the `n3fit` design.

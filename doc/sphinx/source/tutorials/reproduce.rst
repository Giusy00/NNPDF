How to reproduce an NNPDF4.0 fit
================================================================================

Here we describe how to reproduce the NNPDF4.0 PDF sets that are publicly
available through LHAPDF as discussed in section 10 of the NNPDF4.0 paper
:cite:p:`nnpdf40`.


The files needed to reproduce the results are available in the folder
|n3fit_nnpdf40_folder|_
of the `project repository <https://github.com/NNPDF/nnpdf>`_ on Github. The
`.yml` files referenced on this page can be found in that folder.

.. |n3fit_nnpdf40_folder| replace:: ``n3fit/runcards/reproduce_nnpdf40``
.. _n3fit_nnpdf40_folder: https://github.com/NNPDF/nnpdf/tree/master/n3fit/runcards/reproduce_nnpdf40

The exact :ref:`conda environment <conda>`, including all transitive
dependencies, used to produce all the publicly released PDF sets has been
preserved to ensure precise reproducibility.
The environment can be found in the `project repository <https://github.com/NNPDF/nnpdf/tree/master/n3fit/runcards/reproduce_nnpdf40/nnpdf40_env.yml>`_
It can be generated and activated by running

.. code:: bash

    conda env create --file nnpdf40_env.yaml
    conda activate nnpdf40

Next, using this environment, we can produce the fits in the
:ref:`usual way <run-n3fit-fit>`. The names of the runcards in the
``reproduce_nnpdf40/`` folder are the same as those of the
corresponding (public) LHAPDF grids of the same name. For example, baseline fit
with :math:`\alpha_s(m_Z)=0.118` and a  variable-flavor-number scheme with up to
five active flavors can be generated with ``NNPDF40_nnlo_as_0118_1000.yml``.

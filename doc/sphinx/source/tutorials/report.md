# How to generate a report

## Comparing two fits

Often times after completing a fit, one may want to quickly generate a report between
the newly made fit and another, older, fit, perhaps the baseline `t0`.

Instead of creating a `validphys` runcard from scratch, one can quickly generate such a report
using the command `vp-comparefits -i`, where the `-i` flag runs the script in interactive
mode.

The user is then prompted to enter the name of the current fit (that is, the fit that they have just run),
the reference fit (the baseline fit that they wish to make a comparison with respect to), the title of the report
(though a sensible default is suggested), the name of the author, any keywords for the report, and a choice of
whether or not to use a theory covariance matrix for the statistical estimators that will be used in the
report (the default is to include the contribution due to the theory covariance matrix).

The resulting report produces a quick summary of the two fits, highlighting all pertinent plots and statistical
estimators. The report can be uploaded to the server by using `vp-upload <output folder>`, where the folder is
called `output` by default.

## Generating a report from scratch

Suppose, however, that we want to generate a custom report that includes plots and statistics that are not
included as part of the report generated by `vp-comparefits`. We may be lucky enoguh to find an example runcard
that produces what we need in `validphys2/examples`. However, we may need to write our own own `yaml` runcard
from scratch.

Suppose we want to have histograms of the χ2 per replica for some set of experimental datasets.

The calling of `validphys` actions are used as per normal. The action we are looking for is `plot_chi2dist`.

```yaml
meta:
  title: Distribution plots per replica across experiments
  author: Shayan Iranipour
  keywords: [chi2, replica, distribution, DISonly]

fit: NNPDF31_nnlo_as_0118_DISonly

pdf:
  from_: "fit"

experiments:
  from_: "fit"

theoryid: 53

use_cuts: "fromfit"

template_text: |
  # Histograms of χ2
  ## DIS only distributions
  {@experiments::experiment plot_chi2dist@}

actions_:
  - report(main=True)
```

The `report(main=True)` command is what generates the report. We can customize the formatting of the report using
`markdown` syntax. Note for example that `# Histograms of χ2` gives this section where we will find our plot an
appropriate title.

If the `template_text` section of the runcard becomes large and unwieldy, it may be preferable to put the information
from this section in a separate file. In such cases one can create a markdown template file, usually called `template.md`
such as

```md
# Histograms of χ2
## DIS only distributions
{@experiments::experiment plot_chi2dist@}
```

and change the `template_text` section of the runcard to the following

```yaml
template: template.md
```

where this assumes that `template.md` is in the same folder as that in which you execute the `validphys` command.

The `meta` field is important for retrieving the report once it has been uploaded to the `vp server`. `title` and
`author` are fields that appear when browsing through reports while the `keywords` allow quick retrieval of the report by
the search functionality of the server. Setting appropriate keywords is especially important when working on a big
project, within which it is likely that many reports will be produced. In such cases a `keyword` should be chosen for
the project and set in each uploaded report.

# How to generate APPLgrids

`APPLgrids` are the partonic cross sections needed to compute hadronic observables (proton-proton collisions).
These QCD-perturbative components are generated by `Monte-Carlo` simulation and tabulated in `.root` format.

After installing `MCFM-6.8` interfaced with `mcfm-bridge-0.0.34-nnpdf` (see Installation in~).
Follow the following steps to generate `APPLgrids`.

## Configuration in mcfm-bridge-0.0.34-nnpdf
The first step is to setup the kinematics of the cross-section distribution you're interested in.
To do that, you have to edit `mcfm-bridge-0.0.34-nnpdf/src/mcfm_interface.cxx` by doing the following:

1. Binning:

    In `void book_grid()`, you should dictate the:
    - Type of process: `mcfm-z` for z production, `mcfm-TT` for ttbar, etc.
    - `q2Low`, `q2Up`, `nQ2bins` and `qorder` are binning information for the grid constructor.
    - `Ngrids` the number of grids generated. For example, if your cross-section is double differential in var1(10 bins) and var2(3 bins). You can generate 3 grids corresponding to var2 that each contain 10 bins of var1.
    - `strcpy(gridFiles[0],"_yZ.root");` this dictates the name of the output grid. In our example `LHCBZ13TEV_yZ.root`.
    - `nObsBins[0] = 17;` the number of bins.
    - `static const double _y[18]` the breakdown of binning.
    - `obsBins[0] = { _y };` the type of observable.

    **example:**
    ```
        else if ( glabel == "LHCBZ13TEV" )
        {
            std::cout << "LHCb Z -> e+ e- rapidity distribution, 294 pb-1, 13 TeV" << std::endl;
            pdf_function = "mcfm-z";
            q2Low   = 8315.17, q2Up = 8315.19;
            nQ2bins = 3;
            qorder  = 1;

            Ngrids  = 1;
            strcpy(gridFiles[0],"_yZ.root");

            nObsBins[0] = 17;

            static const double _y[18] = { 2.000, 2.125, 2.250, 
                                        2.375, 2.500, 2.625, 
                                        2.750, 2.875, 3.000, 
                                        3.125, 3.250, 3.375, 
                                        3.500, 3.625, 3.750, 
                                        3.875, 4.000, 4.250 };

            obsBins[0] = { _y };

        }
    ```

2. Specify the distribution (here, it's a distribution in rapidity of the outcoming particles 3 and 4):

    In `void getObservable(const double evt[][mxpart])`, you should add the name of your dataset and determine the kinematic variable that the cross-section will span over.
    **example:**
    ```
    else if (glabel == "LHCBZ13TEV")
        {
        Observable [ 0 ] = rapidity34;
        }
    ```

## Configuration of RunCard in MCFM-6.8
For this, you need to duplicate the default run card: `cp MCFM-6.8/Bin/input.DAT MCFM-6.8/Bin/LHCBZ13TEV.dat`.
and edit the later according to the information in the paper, e.g the kinematic cuts, update the masses and theory settings etc.

# How to list the available fits

The bulk of the available fits can be found by going to the
[fits folder](https://data.nnpdf.science/fits/) of the NNPDF data server. Some other fits may be
found in standalone folders in the [home folder](https://data.nnpdf.science/) of this server, but
of course finding a specific fit here may require some digging. For help in accessing the server,
please see [here](NNPDF-server). For information on how to download fits and other resources,
please see the [Downloading resources](download) section of the vp-guide.

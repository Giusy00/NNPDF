Experimental data
-----------------

* JR has provided the final version of the CMS jets
FK tables
Now, together with the C-factors that SC has produced, we have
all the theory ready to fit the various jet datasets.

* SC has produced also the missing C-factors from CMS, now
everything is available. As expected, at the Tevatron the NNLOthres
and NNLOexact for the gg channel are much closer than at the LHC,
though we still might need to exclude the bin with highest rapidity.

* We agreed to exclude D0 from the final dataset (needs IR safe cone algorithm
at NNLO, different from the midpoint used in the data), though it
will be interesting to see the numbers that Joao produces with
SIScone

* After some discussion, we agreed on the following criterion to exclude
data from the NLO and NNLO fits

- NNLO

Compare the difference between the NNLOthres and NNLOexact calculations
in the gg channel. If the relative difference is smaller than the 
total experimental uncertainty, we include this data point
in the fit, else we exclude it. So the inclusion criterion is

( | NNLOthres_gg - NNLOexact_gg | /  NNLOexact_gg ) <
(sigma_exp / cv_exp ) 

For jet data, this criterion is applied separately for each point
in pt and rapidity. 

For the DY of course we have the exact NNLO QCD and NLO EW calculation,
which are exact, but we also have the QED calculation (which has
large uncertainties), so the criterion of inclusion is

( | NNLO_QCD+QED - NNLO_QCD | /  NNLO_QCD ) <
(sigma_exp / cv_exp ) 

which basically excludes the bin with largest invariant mass,
Mll > 200 GeV

- NLO

Compare the difference between the exact calculations at NNLO
and NLO in the gg channel, with the experimental uncertainty.
The criterion for inclusion in the NLO fit is

( | NNLOexact_gg - NLOexact_gg | /  NLOexact_gg ) <
2 * (sigma_exp / cv_exp ) 

Again, for jet data this is applied on a point by point basis,
while for DY data it is applied to the average over
a given mass bin.


The idea is that while at NNLO we want to be conservative to allow
biasing the fit with the wrong theory, at NLO we can be more relaxed
since the difference between NLO and NNLO is an inherent theoretical
uncertainty, we only want to avoid extreme cases where an abnormally large
chi2 biases the minimization.

* SC will take care of the implementation of these cuts in the filter:
all the cuts choice should be available from the config file

* With this, the NNPDF3.0 dataset is final. We agree to postpone
the addition of any new dataset for when NNPDF3.0 is completed.
The W pt data, which is now available, will make it into the
NNPDF3.0 dataset (only in the NLO fit)

Fitting Methodology
--------------------

* We are satisfied with the look-back method

* Check suggested by LDD, the delta criterion, has been
successfully demonstrated by Chris

* The results show that with a suitable choice of delta,
the 20K fit and the 100K look-back fits would look
essentially the same

* These tests suggest that delta=1 is a suitable value

* The fit with delta=10 looks quite similar to the fit with delta=1,
except that the distribution of training lengths look rather better
(but no real physical improvement is improved)

* But delta=0 and delta=1 they are exactly the same, but the effect
is clearly small, specially at the level of PDFs, but visible at the
level of chi2
Also using delta=1 also helps in removing the occasional outliers

* The delta test is consistent, but for our default fits we will use
the simplest possible criterion, in this case delta=0
The optimal value of delta might depend on the dataset
and also we would still need to determine the optimal value of delta
in the fits to experimental data

* CD has also performed fits with different training fractions
Our choice of ftr is close to being optimal, so these checks are also
satisfactory

Fits to real data
-----------------

* We agreed on the following final default settings for the final fit
-> Fixed length, look-back stopping, 40K

* JR will take care of running fits to real data with the final
methodology and theory once the implementation of all kinematical
cuts for jets and DY data is available

* We discovered a trivial bug in the ATLAS high-mass DY in the
EWK C-factors file that has been corrected

* For CMSDY, EWK help except for the highest mass bin,
where corrections are large and also where QED corrections
(not included) are also large

* We compared the the results provided by AG and MU from their
data document
Figure 12 of page 15
https://www.wiki.ed.ac.uk/download/attachments/173003365/newLHCdata.pdf 
with those of the Petriello, arxiv:1312.3972, like Fig. 9, and it looks
like that our K-factors looks very difference
QED and EWK tend to be anti-correlated in Petriello paper

* We agreed of the need to recheck the comparison with the Petriello paper
and our own FEWZ calculations. MU and AG will redo some of the
plots in the Petriello paper as final cross-check

* At the rapidity edges we also get funny behaviors
We agreed to remove from the CMSDY2D the points at the highest rapidity,
where cross-sections are very small and a small problem with systematic
error might transate into a big mismatch between data and theory

* So the summary of the agreed cuts for CMSDY

- Common cuts NLO and NNLO

Cut M > 200 GeV -> large QED corrections
For each M bin, cut data y > 2.2 (last bin, unreliable data, too small xsec)

- At NLO

Remove the bin with smallest invariant mass
(due to large C-factors at NNLO)

* Once SC has modified the code to make the implementation
of these kinematical cuts possible, JR will run the final NNPDF3.0 fits
In particular also fits with different datasets

* SC keeps working on  the miniMC

* JI -> Redo correlation analysis
At this point this is an important a posteriori checks
Wait until we have the final fit to data, with jets and so on
Also on the closure -> This is available, NH+CD prepare everything

* We agreed to begin to write the various methodology sections of the
paper. JR will split the draft into three sections

i) PDF parametrization
Positivity
Change of basis
Preprocessing
...

ii) Fitting methodology
New Ga
look-back stopping

iii) Closure testing
Validation of fitting methodoloy
Description of all tests performed, see SF talk at PDF4LHC
Closure test reweighting

CD+LDD will draft a first version of these three sections
